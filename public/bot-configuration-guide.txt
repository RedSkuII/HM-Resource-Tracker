DISCORD BOT CONFIGURATION GUIDE
Resource Tracker - Bot Dashboard Documentation
====================================================================

QUICK TIP
---------
Hold Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (Mac) to select multiple channels 
or roles in the dropdowns below.

====================================================================
SERVER SELECTION & SORTING
====================================================================

Discord servers are automatically sorted in the following order:

1. Servers with bot installed (marked with ✅) appear first
2. Then alphabetically by server name
3. Servers without the bot (marked with ⚠️) appear at the bottom
4. Your owned servers show a 👑 crown icon

====================================================================
MULTI-SELECT CHANNELS & ROLES
====================================================================

You can select multiple channels and roles for each setting:

• Bot Channels: Where the bot posts stock/inventory updates (blue tags)
• Order Channels: Where members can place orders (green tags)
• Admin Roles: Roles that can manage bot configuration (purple tags)

Selected items appear as colored tags below the dropdown. Click the × 
on any tag to remove it.

====================================================================
POINTS SYSTEM & BONUSES
====================================================================

The Resource Update Bonus (%) field controls point multipliers when 
members update resources. This scales from 0% to 200%:

• 0%: Base points only (0.1 per resource added)
• 50%: 1.5× multiplier (0.15 per resource)
• 100%: 2× multiplier (0.2 per resource) - Default
• 200%: 3× multiplier (0.3 per resource) - Maximum

Note: Bonuses only apply to ADD actions, not SET or REMOVE operations.

====================================================================
BOT BEHAVIOR TOGGLES
====================================================================

✅ Auto-Update Discord Embeds
   When enabled, the bot automatically updates stock embeds in Discord 
   whenever resources change on the website. Disable this if you prefer 
   manual updates.

✅ Notify on Website Resource Changes
   When enabled, the bot sends notifications to bot channels when 
   resources are updated via the website. Useful for keeping the 
   community informed.

✅ Allow Public Orders
   When enabled, any server member can place orders. When disabled, 
   only users with admin roles can place orders (more restricted mode).

====================================================================
WORKFLOW FOR SERVER OWNERS
====================================================================

1. Select your Discord server from the dropdown (bot must be installed)
2. Link it to an in-game guild (the database that stores resources)
3. Choose bot channels where inventory updates will be posted
4. Choose order channels where members can request resources
5. Select admin roles that can manage the bot configuration
6. Set the resource update bonus percentage (0-200%)
7. Configure notification preferences with the three toggles
8. Click Save Configuration

====================================================================
MULTI-SERVER BEST PRACTICES
====================================================================

• Each Discord server can link to one in-game guild
• Multiple Discord servers can link to the same in-game guild 
  (useful for alliances)
• Each server can have different bonus percentages and notification 
  settings
• Admin roles are server-specific, not shared across servers

====================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
====================================================================

❌ Can't see my Discord server in the list?
   Make sure you've granted the app permission to see your servers 
   when logging in. Try logging out and back in, and check the OAuth 
   permissions.

⚠️ Server shows "Bot needs to be added to this server"?
   The bot isn't installed on that server. Only servers where the bot 
   is installed can be configured. Add the bot to your server first.

🔄 Changes not saving?
   Check the browser console for errors. Make sure you've selected at 
   least one in-game guild. Verify you have admin permissions on the 
   Discord server.

📊 Bot not posting updates?
   Ensure "Auto-Update Discord Embeds" is enabled. Check that the bot 
   has permissions to post in the selected bot channels. Verify the 
   channel IDs are correct.
